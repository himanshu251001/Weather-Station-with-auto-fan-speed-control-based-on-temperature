# Weather-Station-with-auto-fan-speed-control-based-on-temperature

In addressing the problem statement, our project aims to tackle the increasing demand for accurate 
and real-time weather information through the exploration of the Internet of Things (IoT). 
Leveraging the WiFi capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico W, we seek to establish a seamless 
transmission of weather data from the versatile BMP280 sensor to Blynk 2.0 Applications. The 
existing challenge lies in the cost and maintenance associated with traditional centralized weather 
stations, which often rely on an expensive network of sensors and reporting stations. By harnessing 
the power of low-cost and easy-to-use micro-controller boards, specifically the Raspberry Pi Pico 
W, our project endeavours to provide a cost-effective solution. The integration of the BMP280 
sensor enables the collection of crucial data, including temperature,altitude, and barometric 
pressure. The real-time remote monitoring and visualization capabilities offered by Blynk's dynamic 
IoT platform add a layer of accessibility and convenience, empowering users to access weather 
information at their fingertips. This innovative approach not only addresses the financial barriers 
associated with setting up and maintaining traditional weather stations but also opens up possibilities 
for diverse applications, ranging from weather forecasting and climate research to agricultural 
decision-making. The synergy among Raspberry Pi Pico W, BMP280, and Blynk establishes a 
foundation for a potent and user-friendly weather monitoring system, contributing to the 
advancement of IoT in the realm of weather data transmission and visualization.Also, we have implemeted automation of fan speed attached with the circuit depending on the temperature of the surronding,thus also show casing the auotomation benefits of Iot in real life.
